Create default notification for NotifySend?

Do other desktopo notification systems accept a message summary and message body? If not, I will have to rethink the DesktopNotification interface.
Perhaps there is an extra abstraction layer in there.
For full flexibility, I should probably pass a NotifySend message into DesktopNotification. This way DesktopNotification doesn't need to know any details of how NotifySend creates its messages.
The downside is that the end-user needs to know how to use NotifySend, but maybe that isn't so bad. They do want the message to be customized, right?
